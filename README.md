Project Aquarium Simulation
Aquarium Simulation is an object-oriented, interactive application written in C++. This application renders an aquarium where different species of fish could virtually exist. They all have some form of unique behaviours and specific animations.

Features
Dynamic Fish Behaviour: dynamic: Fish swim around the aquarium, reversing direction when they hit the edges, animate smoothly.
Object-Oriented Design: It utilizes the principles of inheritance and polymorphism in design. Each fish variety is a subclass with its own peculiar behavior.
User Interaction: User will be able to add/remove the fish and see the aquarium at runtime with the fishes swimming.

Technologies
Language: C++
Framework: wxWidgets - provides a GUI and event handling
Design Patterns: Patterns implemented for handling files, animation, and object management.

How It Works
The aquarium simulation starts with an empty scene. The user populates the aquarium by adding fish via a menu. Each fish object is autonomous in contributing to an animated aquarium. The reaction of fish to boundary constraints and their animation, as swimming in both directions, make for a realistic setting.
